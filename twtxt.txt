2016-02-09T13:57:59+01:00	@<buckket https://buckket.org/twtxt.txt> something like https://gitter.im/ or a freenode channel?
2016-02-11T15:10:00+01:00	working on a web-ui for twtxt (preview at https://web.twtxt.org/ )
2016-02-12T17:47:18+01:00	Hey @<reednj http://reednj.com/reednj.twtxt.txt> and @<xena https://xena.greedo.xeserv.us/files/xena.txt>! do you want to work on an effort to streamline #twtxt registry apis? My proposal: https://github.com/DracoBlue/twtxt-registry
2016-02-12T17:54:58+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I implemented a proposal for such api here https://github.com/DracoBlue/twtxt-registry. Example response is: https://registry.twtxt.org/api/plain/users
2016-02-12T18:13:32+01:00	@<buckket https://buckket.org/twtxt.txt> cool
2016-02-12T20:37:51+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> that's the server for https://web.twtxt.org - will add proper User-Agent-String + Modified+Since soon. Fetches every minute if users are using it. Load is ok? /cc @<quite https://lublin.se/twtxt.txt>
2016-02-12T20:53:15+01:00	added mentions-support by querying registry.twtxt.org to https://web.twtxt.org/
2016-02-12T20:53:31+01:00	You have to use javascript:fetcher.login('https://example.org/twtxt') to login. I will add UI for that later.
2016-02-12T20:54:37+01:00	@<xena https://xena.greedo.xeserv.us/files/xena.txt> happens ;)

It tweets as '2016-02-13T03:28:46+00:00' but, it's still 2016/12/02 http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone/utc
2016-02-12T23:57:17+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I added memcached and user agent to my registry, so you should see some 304 now from me!

2016-02-14T21:30:30+01:00	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> thank you!

2016-02-16T21:10:03+01:00	@<reednj http://reednj.com/reednj.twtxt.txt> please upgrade your client, to have proper mentions in your tweets ;)
2016-02-16T21:11:30+01:00	@<reednj http://reednj.com/reednj.twtxt.txt> the .txt files look good. Can you provide the mentions also by url? Ideally with /api/plain/mentions like described at http://twtxt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/registry.html#query-for-mentions

2016-03-13T21:42:54+01:00	@<buckket https://buckket.org/twtxt.txt> yep ;). I think the ideas in #48 are already quite good!
2016-03-13T22:39:10+01:00	@<mdom https://mdom.github.io/twtxt.txt> I am working on the same thing for https://web.twtxt.org right now, too! :)
2016-03-13T23:00:18+01:00	/me added /me support to https://web.twtxt.org
2016-03-14T14:17:21+01:00	@<kdave https://kdave.github.io/twtxt.txt> I don't think, it's necessary to merge http+https. People can add themself only with https. /cc @<david http://post.aldebaran.uberspace.de/twtxt/david.txt>
2016-03-14T14:21:50+01:00	@<kdave https://kdave.github.io/twtxt.txt> https://web.twtxt.org/ works with localstorage already in the browser. (for following users)
2016-03-14T14:28:35+01:00	@<kdave https://kdave.github.io/twtxt.txt> ah .. missread your message. What alternative way would you use for the web version? I would like to store the info within a config file, too. E.g. the twtxt.txt itself as meta data.
2016-03-14T14:48:53+01:00	@<kdave https://kdave.github.io/twtxt.txt> does the localstorage version not work in your fav. browser?
2016-03-15T09:46:26+01:00	@<kdave https://kdave.github.io/twtxt.txt> I can see if I can create a version, which tries to store the info, and falls back to cookies or no storage at all.
2016-03-15T10:13:06+01:00	@<kdave https://kdave.github.io/twtxt.txt> do you want a subdomain of twtxt.org?
2016-03-17T09:21:21+01:00	@<reednj_tw http://twtxt.reednj.com/t/reednj/twtxt.txt> yep. Etag + If-None-Match is way better, because it usually works with md5 on the content. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_ETag /cc @<buckket https://buckket.org/twtxt.txt>
2016-03-17T09:27:00+01:00	@<mdom https://mdom.github.io/twtxt.txt> do you really need a second config file? Can't you use an own [txtnix] section in twtxt's config file? http://twtxt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/configuration.html#configuration
2016-03-17T13:19:37+01:00	@<reednj http://reednj.com/reednj.twtxt.txt> manually ;). I thought about it, but since the usernames can be different I droped that idea.

2016-03-21T13:20:12.076Z	From now on https://web.twtxt.org will only deliver the latest 20 twtxt messages (/user) to save bandwith. 304 Not Modified via E-Tag is also supported.

2016-03-21T20:09:37.726Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> ok, I disabled it. will work on a fix tomorrow. sorry for the issues. :(
2016-03-21T20:11:15.036Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> btw. 37.120.16.189 is not my ip ;)
2016-03-21T22:52:54.085Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> Is fetching every 10 minutes for the registry and the webclients ok? Maybe we need something like "/changefreq hourly" as meta data for registries/clients.
2016-03-21T23:02:23.442Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I changed it to 100 times a day with https://github.com/DracoBlue/twtxt-registry/commit/8cb58f8a37ad51bbfb56bd6e7235bfd092aae0ba ? Is that ok for you?
2016-03-22T00:02:40.690Z	@<kas https://enotty.dk/twtxt.txt> I updated the registry to interpret the robots.txt (your entries won't be indexed anymore) + the Crawl-Delay directive of robots.txt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard#Crawl-delay_directive
